When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your 
work local?
A: When i want to share my work with a collaborator(s) or when i want to work 
from multiple machines and sync the work

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A: Doing it manually assures that what i have is stable, so i can do the update
when i am ready, so that none of my in-progress work gets broken
   
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?
A: Forks are clones that are done for me by Github so that my repo is hosted
on their server as a remote. A clone is when i get a local copy of a repo on my
local working directory. A branch is a commit of my repository with a special 
label.
   
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
